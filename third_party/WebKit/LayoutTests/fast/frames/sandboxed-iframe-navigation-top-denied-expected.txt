CONSOLE ERROR: line 2: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to initiate navigation for frame with URL 'navigate-top-to-fail.html'. The frame attempting navigation of the top-level window is sandboxed, but the 'allow-top-navigation' flag is not set.

CONSOLE ERROR: line 2: Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to set the 'location' property on 'Window': The current window does not have permission to navigate the target frame to 'fail-and-notify-done.html'.
This test verifies that a sandboxed IFrame cannot navigate the top-level frame without allow-top-navigation. This test passes if the navigation does not occur.
