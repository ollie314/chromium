This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS when duration is changed 
FAIL when endDelay is changed assert_equals: set negative endDelay so as endTime is less than currentTime expected 0 but got 1
PASS when iterations is changed 
FAIL when currentTime changed in duration:1000, delay: 500, endDelay: -500 assert_equals: set currentTime 1000 expected 0 but got 1
FAIL when currentTime changed in duration:1000, delay: -500, endDelay: -500 assert_equals: when currentTime 0 expected 0 but got 1
Harness: the test ran to completion.
