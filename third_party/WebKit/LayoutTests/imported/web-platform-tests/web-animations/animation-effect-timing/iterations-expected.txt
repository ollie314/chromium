This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL set iterations 2 anim.effect.getComputedTiming is not a function
FAIL set iterations Infinity anim.effect.getComputedTiming is not a function
FAIL set negative iterations assert_throws: function "function () {
    anim.effect.timing.iterations = -1;
  }" did not throw
FAIL set negative infinity iterations  assert_throws: function "function () {
    anim.effect.timing.iterations = -Infini..." did not throw
FAIL set NaN iterations assert_throws: function "function () {
    anim.effect.timing.iterations = NaN;
  }" did not throw
Harness: the test ran to completion.
