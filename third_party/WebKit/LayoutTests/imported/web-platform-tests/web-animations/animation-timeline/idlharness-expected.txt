This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Web Animations API: DocumentTimeline tests 
PASS AnimationTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS AnimationTimeline interface object length 
PASS AnimationTimeline interface object name 
FAIL AnimationTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of AnimationTimeline.prototype expected "[object AnimationTimelinePrototype]" but got "[object AnimationTimeline]"
PASS AnimationTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
FAIL AnimationTimeline interface: attribute currentTime assert_equals: setter must be undefined for readonly attributes expected (undefined) undefined but got (function) function "function () { [native code] }"
FAIL DocumentTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL DocumentTimeline interface object length assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL DocumentTimeline interface object name assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL DocumentTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL DocumentTimeline interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL DocumentTimeline must be primary interface of document.timeline assert_own_property: self does not have own property "DocumentTimeline" expected property "DocumentTimeline" missing
FAIL Stringification of document.timeline assert_equals: class string of document.timeline expected "[object DocumentTimeline]" but got "[object AnimationTimeline]"
PASS AnimationTimeline interface: document.timeline must inherit property "currentTime" with the proper type (0) 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
