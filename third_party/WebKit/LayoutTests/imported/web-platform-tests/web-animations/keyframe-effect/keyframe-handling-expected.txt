This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Overlapping keyframes at 0 and 1 use the appropriate value when the progress is outside the range [0, 1] assert_equals: When progress is negative, the first keyframe with a 0 offset should be used expected "0" but got "0.151456"
PASS Overlapping keyframes between 0 and 1 use the appropriate value on each side of the overlap point 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
